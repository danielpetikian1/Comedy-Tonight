## Current TODO's

We are going to jump past iterating on the DB we made and go straight to getting information from the internet.

Before that we need to make some sort of 'state' system, or a way to keep track of the animals:

- that have been said already
- that have been said recently (last 5 animals max)

Those functions need to be made - I would store the recent animals and the animals mentioned already in a class variable, and define a couple of methods that check those.

Next, we need to define some kind of way we are going to get animals - probably some API. before that we need to come up with a "framework" for the kind of animal we get. this we need to meet on and go over as non-trivial and going to determine a lot (this was the numbering system I came up w/ but now we are using the internet so will not be the same).

By the end of this week the state system must be done and we need to be getting animals from the internet in some semi-cohesive way.
